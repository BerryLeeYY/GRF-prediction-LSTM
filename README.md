# GRF-prediction-LSTM
## Introduction
Kinematic and GRF are the information when it comes to movement analysis. Such as gait analysis, the researchers use GRF signal to determine the gait phase. However, it is difficult to collect all information because of the high cost of the equipment. Thanks for the advanced technology, nowaday people can easyily gather the kinematic data by using IMU or a video motion capture system. Therefore, in this project, I am going to show you how to use kinematic signal to predict GRF signal by using LSTM.
## Aim
Predict GRF signal by using LSTM
